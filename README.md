# Dashboard
A basic Dashboard/Landing page to showcase the use of Javascript APIs

**APIs used**
- Unsplash to generate a random background image
- Coingecko to display daily Dogecoin prices
- Openweathermap to load weather data based on local latitude/longitude

**Possible Improvements**
The possibilities of what can be added or expanded on this project are quite literally endless.
- placeholder text or spinning icons while data is being loaded.
- text to display if location data isn't available/access is denied
- user settings panel
- ability to select what cryptocurrency to display market data for
- Todo lists, event calendars, whatsapp/facebook chat, or any number of different apps could be added
